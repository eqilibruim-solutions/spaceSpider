# spaceSpider
SpaceSpider is an artificial intelligence organsim. This organism has an artificial brain that computes mechine learning to distribute an array over a given set of instruction. This allows to fill a 3d environment with a spiderWeb from where space designers can segment space layouts or objects. In the future, I want to make it to think building planinng from scanning a site to concepting a solution based real data such as weather info, traffic info, gis data, other syntaxes in space, local culture data, building regulations data and design data.

I hope with your help to make it possible. Please subscribe to this project and let's start building!
