# spaceSpider
SpaceSpider is an artificial intelligence organsim which uses mechine learning to distribute an array over a given set of instruction, thus allowing to fill a 3d environment with a web from where space designers can segment space layouts or objects. In the future, I want to make it to think building planinng from scanning a site to concepting a solution based on data.
